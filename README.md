BikeSharingProject â€“ Berlin

This repository contains the cleaned and combined bike-sharing data from Berlin. The goal of this project is to analyze how factors like time, day, and weather influence bike rental patterns across the city.

**Dataset**

- **File**: `BikeSharingData_Berlin_combinedandcleaned.pkl`  
- **Format**: Python Pickle file (`.pkl`)  
- **Contents**:  
- Bike rental records  
- Timestamps (date, time, weekday, etc.)
- Station information  
- Weather data


**Project Overview**

This project was developed using Google Colab and focuses on:

Cleaning and combining multiple raw data sources

Feature engineering (date/time columns, weather conditions)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualizations

Identifying patterns in bike-sharing usage based on time and weather


**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Google Colab

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

pickle


**Key Insights**

Rush Hour Peaks: Rentals peak during morning and evening commute times.

Weather Impact: Rentals increase with warmer temperatures and decrease during rain.

Weekday Trends: Weekdays show higher usage than weekends, consistent with commuter behavior.


**Outcome**

The cleaned and processed dataset (BikeSharingData_Berlin_combinedandcleaned.pkl) is ready for further data analysis, machine learning modeling, or visualization/dashboard creation.
