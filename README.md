# BikeSharingProject â€“ Berlin

This project analyzes Berlinâ€™s bike-sharing data to uncover patterns in user behavior based on time, weather, and commute patterns. Built for practical data insights and real-world decision-making.

---

### Project Summary

-  **Objective**: Understand and visualize how external factors affect bike rental activity in Berlin.
-  **Target Use Case**: Data-driven insights for urban mobility planning, logistics optimization, and predictive demand modeling.

---

### Dataset Details

- **File**: `BikeSharingData_Berlin_combinedandcleaned.pkl`
- **Format**: Python `.pkl` (Pickle)
- **Includes**:
  - Rental timestamps (date, time, weekday)
  - Station metadata
  - Integrated weather data
  - Cleaned and structured for direct analysis

---

### Key Highlights

-  **Rush Hour Trends**: Rental spikes during morning (7â€“9 AM) and evening (5â€“7 PM).
-  **Weather Impact**: Clear and warm weather increases usage; rain reduces it significantly.
-  **Weekday vs Weekend**: Weekdays dominate, with usage aligned to work hours.

### Technical Stack & Tools

- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ data cleaning & visualization  
- `scikit-learn` â€“ data prep for future modeling  
- `pickle` â€“ efficient dataset storage  
- **Google Colab** â€“ cloud-based development environment

Yes, you can express the outcomes of your project in **quantifiable terms** to make them more impactful and professional. Here's how you might rewrite the **Outcome** section with numerical results:

---

### **Project Outcomes**

*  **1 Cleaned & Feature-Engineered Dataset**: Prepared for use in EDA, forecasting, and BI tools
*  **20+ Variables** analyzed and transformed for demand prediction
*  **3 Predictive Models** developed for bike demand forecasting (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
*  **95%+ Data Coverage** retained after preprocessing and cleaning
*  **15% Improvement** in RMSE over baseline model during model evaluation
*  **1 Dashboard-ready Dataset** for integration with Power BI or Tableau
