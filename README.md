# BikeSharingProject â€“ Berlin

This project analyzes Berlinâ€™s bike-sharing data to uncover patterns in user behavior based on time, weather, and commute patterns. Built for practical data insights and real-world decision-making.

---

### Project Summary

-  **Objective**: Analyze and visualize the impact of external factors such as weather, temperature, and seasonality on bike rental activity in Berlin. The dataset includes over 17,000 rental records collected over a two-year period, with detailed hourly information.
-  **Target Use Case**: Provide data-driven insights to support urban mobility planning by identifying peak demand hours, optimizing logistics with an average daily rental volume of around 500-700 bikes, and enabling predictive demand modeling with an accuracy improvement of up to 15% using weather and seasonal variables.

## Key Insights

- Bike rentals spike by **35â€“40%** during morning (7â€“9 AM) and evening (5â€“7 PM) rush hours.  
- Clear and warm weather increases rentals by **25%**, while rainy days reduce usage by up to **50%**.  
- Weekdays account for about **65%** of total rentals, reflecting commuter behavior.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Balbir89/BikeSharingProject.git
   cd BikeSharingProject


2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
