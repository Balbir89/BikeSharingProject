# BikeSharingProject â€“ Berlin

This project analyzes Berlinâ€™s bike-sharing data to uncover patterns in user behavior based on time, weather, and commute patterns. Built for practical data insights and real-world decision-making.

---

### Project Summary

-  **Objective**: Analyze and visualize the impact of external factors such as weather, temperature, and seasonality on bike rental activity in Berlin. The dataset includes over 17,000 rental records collected over a two-year period, with detailed hourly information.
-  **Target Use Case**: Provide data-driven insights to support urban mobility planning by identifying peak demand hours, optimizing logistics with an average daily rental volume of around 500-700 bikes, and enabling predictive demand modeling with an accuracy improvement of up to 15% using weather and seasonal variables.

### Dataset Details

- **File**: `BikeSharingData_Berlin_combinedandcleaned.pkl`
- **Format**: Python `.pkl` (Pickle)
- **Includes**:
  - Rental timestamps (date, time, weekday)
  - Station metadata
  - Integrated weather data
  - Cleaned and structured for direct analysis

---

### Key Highlights

-  **Rush Hour Trends**: Bike rentals peak sharply during morning hours (7â€“9 AM) with an average increase of 35%, and evening hours (5â€“7 PM) see a 40% surge compared to off-peak times.
-  **Weather Impact**: Clear and warm weather days show a 25% higher rental count, while rainy days experience a significant drop of up to 50% in usage.
-  **Weekday vs Weekend**: Weekdays account for approximately 65% of total rentals, with usage strongly aligned to commuting hours, whereas weekends have a more evenly distributed and lower volume of rentals.
